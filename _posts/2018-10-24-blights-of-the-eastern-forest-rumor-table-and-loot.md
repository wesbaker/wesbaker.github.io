As part of [my review for _Sky ov Crimson Flame_]({% post_url 2018-10-24-sky-ov-crimson-flame %}), I mentioned that I wanted to make a rumor table and roll up some loot for the _Blights of the Eastern Forest_ hex crawl. Here's what I've come up with.

**Warning**: If I'm your GM, stop reading now.

## Rumor Table

| 1d20 | Rumor |
| ---- | ----- |
| 1 | Deep in the woods life a creature older than the forest itself, capable of bestowing great strength upon those that defeat it. |
| 2 | A creature from times unknown guards a kings random of treasure, but beware its cunning, it’s been fooled before. |
| 3 | Blood runs deep within the forest, spreading death and destruction by corrupting the flora into fauna. |
| 4 | A Chaos Lord lives and breathes under wrathful trees, cleanse the forest to appease the gods. |
| 5 | A corrupted sorceress commands her domain of the western part of the forest, any who enter are never seen from again. |
| 6 | Children are being stolen from their beds at night, never to be seen again. |
| 7 | At night, travelers have seen translucent bears of many colors in the glen near the river’s fork. |
| 8 | A merchant saw bones floating on their own accord while a haunting march was sung all around him. |
| 9 | A king’s betrothed healed all of those who would lay down their arms and sacrifice that which enabled their crimes. |
| 10 | Twelve spheres were set aside for the greater good. |
| 11 | A knight and his squire live through eternal torment, chained to that which they protected to their death. |
| 12 | Many shields were forsaken at this sacred site, but only one heals as if it were its former keepers. |
| 13 | The Wrook sees all that happens in the woods, beware of the creature with the golden orbs for eyes. |
| 14 | Some say all treasure lost in the woods is taken by the Wrook, but beware his murder. |
| 15 | Black birds beware, an uneasy alliance has been formed and the pact kept. |
| 16 | A golden stag wanders the forest, surveying his domain, bow to him and his protection is yours. |
| 17 | The woods will not suffer a bladed weapon, bear only those that fell no trees. |
| 18 | A flying pig?! I’ll believe it when I see it. |
| 19 | Fires have a strange way of pulling you in and seeing something that isn’t there, dontcha think? |
| 20 | Fae creatures roam the river’s edge at night, drowning children and young lovers. |

## Magic Shield at the Sactuary of the Sightless Sisters

I didn't love the idea that the golden shield wasn't slightly magical, so I used the [Weapon and Amror enchantment generator](https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/generators/the-seventh-order-of-the-random-generator/) from Last Gasp Grimoire and rolled that it's a "Shield of Trimuph" which heals 1hp per HD slain which sorta kinda fits in with the whole healing sanctuary thing. It probably needs a downside though...

## Magic Axe in The Wrook's Hut

The Wrook's Hut is supposed to have some magic items, but the party should already have a sword from _Sky ov Crimson Flame_, so I wanted a different weapon. I decided on an axe and used the sentient sword generator from _Dungeon Crawl Classics_ and mostly rolled low, but I like what I came up with.

| Satyrsprawl |
| ----------- |
| Battleaxe, two hands, 1d10 damage
| +1 to attacks and damage
| Wielder can cast _Detect Magic_ twice a day
| Fey Bane, causes painful wounds to fey creatures, inflicts an additional 1d4 damage
